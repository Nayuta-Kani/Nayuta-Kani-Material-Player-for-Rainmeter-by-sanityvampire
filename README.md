# Material Player for Rainmeter by sanityvampire and Nayu
A clean and simple Material Design skin for Rainmeter's NowPlaying plugin.  

Features:
 ✓ Play/pause when cover art is left-clicked
 ✓ Next song when cover art is right-clicked
 ✓ Previous song when cover art is middle-clicked
 ✓ Clickable playback bar to seek within track
 ✓ Conforms to Material Design spec: colors, typography, etc.
 ✓ Responsive, yet low CPU overhead
 ✓ Fits nicely into the Windows Taskbar!
 ✓ Auto hides the skin if nothing is playing on the chosen player.
 
Note:
By default, the chosen player is iTunes. Do change the player if you're using a different player by opening "Material Player.ini" and editing "Player=iTunes" line with the correct player under "[Variables]"
